ðŸ“š Bookstore SQL Data Analysis Project
This project simulates a bookstore database system using PostgreSQL. It includes table creation, data retrieval, and analytical SQL queries to explore customer behavior, sales trends, inventory insights, and book performance

``` sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS BOOKS;
CREATE TABLE BOOKS (
Books_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
Title VARCHAR (100),
Author VARCHAR(100),
Genre VARCHAR(50),
Published_Year INT,
Price NUMERIC(10,2),
Stock INT
);```



```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
Customer_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100),
Email VARCHAR(100),
Phone VARCHAR(15),
City VARCHAR(50),
Country VARCHAR(150)
);```



```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
Order_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
Customer_ID INT REFERENCES Customers(Customer_ID),
Book_ID INT REFERENCES Books(Books_ID),
Order_Date Date,
Quantity INT,
Total_Amount Numeric(10,2)
);```

SELECT * FROM Books;
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Orders;



-- 1) Retrieve all books in the Fiction genre:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM BOOKS
WHERE GENRE = 'Fiction';```



-- 2) Find books published after the year 1950:
```sql
SELECT * FROM BOOKS
WHERE PUBLISHED_YEAR > 1950;```




-- 3) List all customers from the Canada
```sql
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE COUNTRY = 'Canada';```



-- 4) Show orders placed in November 2023:
``` sql
SELECT * FROM ORDERS
WHERE ORDER_DATE BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2023-11-30';```



-- 5) Retrieve the total stock of books available:
``` sql
SELECT SUM(STOCK) AS TOTAL_STOCK FROM BOOKS;```



-- 6) Find the details of the most expensive book:
``` sql
SELECT MAX(PRICE) AS MOST_EXPENSIVE FROM BOOKS;

SELECT * FROM BOOKS ORDER BY PRICE DESC LIMIT 1;```



-- 7) Show all customers who ordered more than 1 quantity of a book:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ORDERS
WHERE QUANTITY>1;```



-- 8) Retrieve all orders where the total amount exceeds $ 20;
```sql
SELECT ORDER_ID,TOTAL_AMOUNT FROM ORDERS
WHERE TOTAL_AMOUNT > 20;```



-- 9) List all genres available in the Books table:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT GENRE FROM BOOKS;```



-- 10) Find the book with the lowest stock:
```sql
SELECT * FROM BOOKS
ORDER BY STOCK
LIMIT 10;```



-- 11) Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders:
```sql
SELECT SUM(TOTAL_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_REVENUE 
FROM ORDERS;```



-- Advanced queries


-- 1) Retreive the total number of books sold for each genre
```sql
SELECT  GENRE, SUM(QUANTITY) AS TOTAL_QTY FROM ORDERS 
INNER JOIN BOOKS 
ON BOOK_ID = BOOKS_ID
GROUP BY GENRE;```



--2) Find the average price of books in the "Fantasy genre:
```sql SELECT AVG(PRICE) AS AVERAGE_PRICE FROM BOOKS
WHERE GENRE = 'Fantasy';```


 
-- 3) List customers who have placed at least 2 orders:
```sql SELECT A.CUSTOMER_ID, A.NAME, COUNT(B.ORDER_ID) AS TOTAL_ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS AS A
INNER JOIN ORDERS AS B
ON A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID
GROUP BY A.CUSTOMER_ID, A.NAME
HAVING COUNT(B.ORDER_ID) >= 2; ```



-- 4) Find the most frequently ordered book
``` sql
SELECT A.BOOK_ID, B.TITLE, COUNT(A.ORDER_ID) AS ORDER_COUNT FROM ORDERS AS A
INNER JOIN BOOKS AS B
ON A.BOOK_ID = B.BOOKS_ID
GROUP BY A.BOOK_ID, B.TITLE
ORDER BY ORDER_COUNT DESC LIMIT 1;```




--5 Show the top 3 most expensive books of fanatasy genre
```sql
SELECT TITLE, PRICE FROM BOOKS
WHERE GENRE = 'Fantasy'
ORDER BY PRICE DESC LIMIT 5; ```



--6 Retrieve the total quantity of books sold by each author
``` sql
SELECT A.AUTHOR, SUM(B.QUANTITY) AS TOTAL_QTY FROM BOOKS AS A
INNER JOIN ORDERS AS B
ON A.BOOKS_ID = B.BOOK_ID
GROUP BY A.AUTHOR; ```



-- 7 List the cities where customers who spent over $30 are located
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(B.CITY), A.TOTAL_AMOUNT FROM ORDERS AS A
INNER JOIN CUSTOMERS AS B
ON  A.CUSTOMER_ID = B.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE A.TOTAL_AMOUNT > 30;```



-- 8) Find the customer who spent the most on orders:
```sql
SELECT C.NAME, SUM(O.TOTAL_AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SPENT FROM CUSTOMERS AS C
INNER JOIN ORDERS AS O
ON  C.CUSTOMER_ID = O.CUSTOMER_ID
GROUP BY C.NAME
ORDER BY TOTAL_SPENT DESC LIMIT 1;```



--9) Calculate the stock remaining after fulfilling all orders:

```sql
SELECT B.BOOKS_ID, B.TITLE, B.STOCK, COALESCE(SUM(O.QUANTITY),0) AS ORDER_QUANTITY,
B.STOCK - COALESCE(SUM(O.QUANTITY),0) AS REMAINING_QUANTITY
FROM BOOKS AS B
LEFT JOIN ORDERS AS O
ON O.BOOK_ID = B.BOOKS_ID
GROUP BY B.BOOKS_ID;```
 





ðŸ“¦ Database Structure
* The project contains three core tables:

* BOOKS: Stores book details including title, author, genre, price, stock, and publication year.

* CUSTOMERS: Holds customer contact and location information.

* ORDERS: Tracks each order with quantity, total amount, and references to books and customers.

## Key Features
Table creation with proper primary and foreign keys

Basic SQL queries for data filtering and aggregation

Advanced SQL analytics using JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING AND COALESCE

ðŸ“ˆ Insights on:

Best-selling books and authors

Top-spending customers

Inventory tracking post-sales

Genre-wise and city-wise performance
